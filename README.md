## Project Goal ðŸš©

The goal is to create an open source instant messaging application based on the security and privacy of the users who are using it. The application allows users to subscribe to the service, to send and receive messages from other subscribed users; to guarantee delivery of the message sent even if the receiver is offline; to guarantee that registration and communication take place in total security, through encrypted management of access keys.

## Skills acquired âœ…

- Writing a Design Document (DD)
- Working with Agile methods and techniques
- Developing a Smartphone App with React Native framework
- Implementing a microservice architecture via API REST
- Analysing a software system according to different architectural views
- Performing Component and Functional Testing
